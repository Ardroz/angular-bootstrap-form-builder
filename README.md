# angular-bootstrap-form-builder

Bower component to create dynamic forms using AngularJS and Bootstrap, took my inspiracion from [Bootstrap Form Builder](http://minikomi.github.io/Bootstrap-Form-Builder/).

## Install

1. `bower install renderteam/angular-bootstrap-form-builder` or [download the zip](https://github.com/renderteam/angular-bootstrap-form-builder/archive/master.zip).
2. Include `build/angular-bootstrap-form-builder.min.js` and `build/css/angular-bootstrap-form-builder.min.css` to your project.
3. Add `renderteam.formbuilder` as a module dependency to your app.
